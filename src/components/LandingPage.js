        <h2>History of Garissa</h2>
        <h3>Before Colonization</h3>
        <p>
          Before the arrival of colonial powers, Garissa was primarily inhabited by Somali pastoralists who engaged in trade with 
          communities across the Horn of Africa. The area was part of a vast network of trade routes that connected the interior 
          of Africa with the coastal regions, facilitating the exchange of goods such as livestock, hides, and ghee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The social structure in Garissa was organized around clans and sub-clans, with community leaders playing a central role 
          in managing resources and resolving conflicts. The people of Garissa maintained close ties with their kin in neighboring 
          regions, and their culture was characterized by a strong sense of identity and resilience.
        </p>
        
        <h3>During Colonization</h3>
        <p>
          The British colonial administration established a presence in Garissa in the late 19th century, marking the beginning of 
          significant changes in the region. The colonial government imposed new administrative boundaries, which often disrupted 
          traditional clan territories and governance structures. The introduction of colonial laws and taxation systems further 
          strained relations between the local communities and the colonial authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, the people of Garissa continued to resist colonial rule, and the region became a focal point 
          for anti-colonial movements. The struggle for independence was marked by both peaceful resistance and armed conflict, 
          as the communities of Garissa sought to reclaim their autonomy and way of life.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Post-Colonization and Independence</h3>
        <p>
          After Kenya gained independence in 1963, Garissa experienced a period of rapid change. The new Kenyan government sought 
          to integrate the northeastern region into the broader national framework, but the process was fraught with challenges. 
          Issues such as underdevelopment, marginalization, and insecurity continued to affect the region, even as efforts were 
          made to improve infrastructure and access to services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the decades following independence, Garissa has seen both progress and setbacks. Development projects aimed at improving 
          healthcare, education, and economic opportunities have been implemented, but the region still faces significant challenges. 
          Today, Garissa stands as a testament to the resilience and determination of its people, who continue to strive for a better 
          future despite the obstacles they face.

          resistance against colonial rule to more recent efforts to promote peace and development, the history of Garissa is rich 
          with stories of courage, struggle, and triumph.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most notable events in recent history was the Garissa University attack in 2015, a tragic incident that drew 
          international attention. The response to this tragedy highlighted the strength and resilience of the community, as they 
          came together to support the victims and rebuild the university.

          Another important aspect of Garissa's history is its role in the fight against poaching and the conservation of wildlife. 
          The nearby Boni Forest, part of the larger Lamu-Boni-Dodori forest ecosystem, is home to a variety of endangered species. 
          Conservation efforts in the area have focused on protecting these species while also supporting the livelihoods of local 
          communities.

          These include projects focused on expanding access to clean water, improving healthcare services, and enhancing educational
